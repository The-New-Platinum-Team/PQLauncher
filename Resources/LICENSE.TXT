By installing and using this Game, you agree to abide by the following conditions of its use listed here and otherwise in the game contents.

IMPORTANT -- READ CAREFULLY: This License Agreement for Stop DeluXe ("Game") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or an entity) and Tekannabrand, Incorporated - the developer of the Game (collectively "Tekannabrand") - by launching the STOP DeluXe Player (including, but not limited to: Installing, having, copying, running this Game), you agree to be bound by the terms of this License Agreement.  If you do not agree to the terms of this License Agreement, you will not install or use this Game until you accept this usage agreement.

EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED BELOW, THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT APPLY TO ALL VERSIONS OF THE GAME:

INTRODUCTION
Thank you for your interest in Tekannabrand Incorporated's modification, STOP DeluXe. We know that agreements aren't fun to read nor do most people look through every sentence to begin with, but we want people to realize that our work is very important to us and we want to help you understand why by letting you know what you may do and cannot do with our Services. Our intent isn't to be autocratic, but to make sure you abide by this legal agreement and get the most stable latest version - we highly advise you not download an older or modified version as Tekannabrand will not support it - because older releases of the game will not be supported by our team. All versions of our previous titles (Marble Blast STOP, Marble Blast STOP II, STOP II, collectively "Previous Releases") are also unsupported. This Game is the core for how our web, server and the Game work in their entirety. STOP DeluXe is the only official Tekannabrand modification. As of 2025, our revived edition of the game should help make this more clear. All this being said, please read this entire document very carefully.

3. LIMITATIONS
(a) No limitations or restrictions for Game installation are provided at this time. Unless specifically provided by your institution or workplace, you may install STOP DeluXe anywhere on your computer. For example, if your academic institution forbids STOP DeluXe to be installed on a school computer, you are responsible for adhering to the rules of your institution, including but not limited to a student handbook or I.T. Policy. Tekannabrand is not responsible if you happen to get into trouble for installing our services to unauthorized digital devices.
(b) Across all versions, select users tested the Game for months during development. In addition the closed testing period was conducted by people who were not involved in its development or originally involved with Marble Blast whatsoever. However, everything may not have been caught - we appreciate anything you find that may improve the Game - the authors of this Game cannot be held responsible for any damage caused to your computer or the software as a result of its use. Everything has wear and tear; the software is provided AS-IS and you agree and are aware that your use of the Game is at your own risk.  
(c) STOP DeluXe is and will never be for sale - it is a free game - however, it is now possible to donate to our mission and our cause. You may only donate to support Tekannabrand. All proceedings are meant to go towards development of future projects and content along with hiring of workers for new projects. You may earn perks and benefits by donating to us on Kofi, depending on what you select.

// -----------------------------------------

4. ORIGINAL CONTENT
(a) STOP DeluXe is a total-conversion modification of an old game called "Marble Blast". (GarageGames/InstantAction). Thus, nobody cannot directly sell it. Attempting to sell the game breaks an agreement between you and GarageGames/InstantAction which is strictly against copyright law.
(b) We aren't allowed to directly sell this Game, nor is anyone else allowed to either. If you have paid money for this modification, you need to report the offender(s) to Tekannabrand by e-mail (info@mail.tekannabrand.org), issue a charge-back, and report the fraudulent transaction to law enforcement especially in the case of card or identity theft. Tekannabrand is NOT responsible for unfortunate circumstances resulted in third-party involvement within.
(c) This modification contains code that were present in the beta and final public releases of all original InstantAction/GarageGames Marble Blast editions & versions. See article 5 for more information.
(d) Tekannabrand takes no credit for original code governed of GarageGames' original work. Such original is therefore employed on the basis that everything distributed through Marble Blast, Marble Blaster, and Marble Blast Gold may be used despite them not being in the public domain.
(e) Before STOP DeluXe 2.4uX, various assets that we once repurposed are the original work of Tekannabrand, Whirligig Studios, and ROBLOX. However, as part of our brand new update, we are currently getting rid of those assets and creating our own in waves. As such, the remaining 20-30 assets from other sources the property of their original authors and may not be reproduced, redistributed, or sold.
	(i) This includes, but isn't limited to, sharing assets on web sites like The Models Resource. Sharing assets like Stages, 3D models, and otherwise is strictly not allowed and will be subject to report and possible deletion.
	(ii) Your attention to this is drawn on article 2 of this License Agreement.

// -----------------------------------------

5. MODIFIED CONTENT
(a) Tekannabrand takes credit for what we have created as part of STOP DeluXe. All content provided to help make the game work may never be reverse engineered, modified, or distributed. 
(b) All assets, textures, game maps, graphics, codebase, logos, names, and all related indications are trademarks of Tekannabrand, Inc., unless otherwise noted of belonging to InstantAction.
	(i) As noted previously, you will not port any content or files from STOP DeluXe to other sources or games (also known as "ripping"). Please do not ask the team for any assets or files. For business to business contact, however, contact us if something we have made interests you. We will be happy to do our best in working with you.
(c) The name STOPX (STOP DeluXe) is in no way affiliated with, supported by or in any other way shape or form related to InstantAction. Marble Blast, Marble Blaster & Marble Blast Gold are registered trademarks of GarageGames. Copyright: "Â© 2002-2006 GarageGames. All rights reserved."
// -----------------------------------------

6. RULES ADHERED WITHIN OUR SERVICES
(a) No cheating; no one likes cheaters because they reduce the quality of play for those trying to achieve special roles and times on the Leaderboards, our web site, and on the STOP DeluXe Discord server. We've disabled many functions that encourage cheating for this purpose. (We personally still don't know why people believe leaving the stage editor and the console up is a great idea because they're prone to many vulnerabilities. I and tens of hundreds of fair players cannot emphasize this enough. We believe that anyone requesting them is trying to cheat.)
(b) STOP DeluXe is a closed-door modification; this is a Marble Blast modification that does not support custom Worlds or assets. It disallows porting anything we made to other games, and disallows any in-game editing software. This modification is for playing, not testing and constructing. For testing, check out Marble Blast GOLD. For constructing and testing, check out PlatinumQuest. This Game is not a testing/construction environment, and must be treated as such as described in section a, of this article.
(b) Verification is required; by installing this game, you agree that any and all #1 Leaderboard spots will automatically be sent to Tekannabrand's server for review, and all footage may be used for promotions and events. Please review our privacy policy carefully for what we collect, don't collect, share, and don't share.
(c) Special roles; in order to obtain a STOPX Colored Role or Absolutist, you must be connected to our servers at all times and meet the minimum requirements. If you qualify for a Colored Role, e-mail us at info@mail.tekannabrand.org to start the process. Otherwise, verification for this perk may take about a week.
(d) Please do not directly report individual cases of cheating to us. Instead, please use the Report feature, which is located throughout the game and our web site. You can use this feature to report records (that violate the rules or are out of sync/experiencing some bugs) or terms of service violations. If you abuse the Reporting system, which includes, but isn't limited to, berating STOPX staff, targeting a player, and false reporting, you will be banned or terminated from STOP DeluXe.
(e) Anything not listed in this document is not an excuse for leeway for loopholes. Edge cases are up to the discretion of Tekannabrand. If you don't see something added in the license agreement or if you have a question, please contact us first. Remember: Tekannabrand has the final say for this agreement and the rules of the Game, not you.


// -----------------------------------------

7. THANK YOU
(a) Tekannabrand appreciates you for reading this far - we know that most people tend to skip to the end and click through buttons to skip to the next step and don't bother reading this as it contains some crap, but when you realize what this license agreement has to say, we hope that you gain common sense and courtesy thereafter. Thank you also for playing this modification - your support makes us think our work is truly worthwhile. We're aware that there are some grumbles in the community about the modification so maybe this will clear some things up. We're hope you are amused, entertained, and energetic - this modification certainly requires it, especially for achieving difficult awards and some world records!
